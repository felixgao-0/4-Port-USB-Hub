# 4 Port USB Hub

I've made a simple 4-port USB hub based on the above-linked tutorial 2-port USB hub. 
Typing on my computer with no usable USB ports right now (Ugh apple with 2 USB ports and both are used by my keyboard and mouse).  
I made this trying to solve my problem, and thought, "Well, if I'm making a PCB anyways, why not double the ports?!?", and guess what I did lol.

JLCPCB quotes my design at $3.10 at their special offer. The only modification I made to settings was choosing a surface finish without lead. 
It will be a while before I'm able to 3D print a cover for it (if I ever do), and I don't want to be exposed to lead trying to plug in a USB stick.

The design process was simple enough. I followed the tutorial up until the whole 4 ports instead of 2 things. 
It became the most confusing laying out the PCB parts, I was just YEETING things across the design panel. 
Recommendation to whoever reads this, your schematic is very useful haha.


## Information for Arcade

This was a blast making this for Arcade! I hope my PC doesn't explode using this (/hj). I would have never touched PCB with my life before this (mainly due to the feeling of it being too complicated and expensive). Yall have seriously changed my life!

To experience this project, you can upload these files to JLCPCB and buy it for yourself (I'm not responsible for ur PC exploding, not that it would hopefully /hj). If you actually do try it let me know what happens!
